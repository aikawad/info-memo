Chapter 2. Domains, Subdomains, and Bounded Contexts
======

There are three things you are going to have to understand very clearly:
- What your **Domain** is
- What your **SubDomains** are
- What your Bounded Contexts are

To succeed in implementing DDD, you have to get these right.

###Road Map to This Chapter###
- Grasp the big pcture of DDD by understanding Domains, Subdomains, and Bounded Contexts.
- Learn why strategic design is so essential, and why designing without it hurts.
- Consider a practical real-world Domain with multiple Subdomains.
- Make sense of Bounded Contexts, both conceptually and technically.

### Naming a Bounded Context ######

>  Did you notice the name *Collaboration Context* used here? This is the way we name a Bounded Context, which is in the form *Name-of-Model* Context. In this casewe use *Collaboration Context* because it is the Bounded Context that contains the domain model of the Cooaboration project. We also have *Identity and Access Context* for the Bounded Context that contains the model of the Identity and Access project, and *Agile Project Management (PM) Context* for the Bounded Context that holds the model of the Agile Project Management project.
